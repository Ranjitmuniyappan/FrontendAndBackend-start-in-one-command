    Certainly! To create a project with a frontend and backend within a project root and start both projects with a single command, you can follow these general steps. I'll assume you are using a common tech stack like Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend, but you can adapt the steps based on your preferred technologies.

    project-root/
    ├── backend/
    │   ├── server.js
    │   ├── ...
    │
    ├── frontend/
    │   ├── src/
    │   ├── public/
    │   ├── ...
    │
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── package.json


    1. Create Project Root:
     - Start by creating a directory for your project. This will be the root directory containing both frontend and backend code.

        mkdir your-project-name
        cd your-project-name
     - create package.json file into your project, copy and past the below given code.

         {
            "name": "home_entrance",
            "version": "1.0.0",
            "scripts": {
                "start": "npm-run-all --parallel start:backend start:frontend",
                "start:backend": "cd backend && node server.js",                //server.js this file you should created inside backend project.
                "start:frontend": "cd frontend && npm start"                    //npm start this command to start reactjs project.
            },
            "devDependencies": {
                "npm-run-all": "^4.1.5"
            }
        }

      - Once package.json file created then install this dependancy
          npm install --save-dev npm-run-all                          //npm-run-all this package allows you to start both project one-by-one.

      - That's all from Root-Project, now continue to create Frontend and Backend project within the Root-Project.


    2. Create Backend Project now
       - Create a new directory for your backend project:
            mkdir backend
            cd backend

       - Initialize a new Node.js project (if you're using Node.js) and install any necessary dependencies:
           npm init -y

       - Install backend dependencies (e.g., Express):
           npm install express

       - Create a basic server file (e.g., server.js) with a simple Express setup:
           // backend/server.js

            const express = require('express');
            const app = express();
            const port = 5000;

            app.get('/', (req, res) => {
              res.send('Hello from the backend!');
            });

            app.listen(port, () => {
              console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
            });



        - Install concurrently in the frontend and backend projects:

            cd ../backend
            npm install concurrently --save-dev


        - That's all now update you backend project's package.json file "server.js" as a start file into script.




    3. Create Frontend Project now

        - Create a new directory for your frontend project:

                mkdir frontend
                cd frontend


        - Initialize a new React project (if you're using React):

            npx create-react-app .

        - Install concurrently in the frontend and backend projects:

            cd frontend
            npm install concurrently --save-dev


    4. Finally we have done development. now let start the project.

        npm start
